object_oriented_programing(OOPS):
                                OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods. ... OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.

class:
      A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


object:
      It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data
    
      Ex:
        For example “Dog” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, Breed, Bark, Sleep, and Eats.


Basic pillers of oops:
                      They are an abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.


Abstraction: 
            Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
            Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces

Encapsulation:
              Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit


Inheritance: 
            JAVA INHERITANCE is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.

Polymorphism:
             Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. ... Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

             We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding

Method_overloading:
                   “Method overloading is a feature of Java in which a class has more than one method of the same name and their parameters are different.”

Method_overriding:
                  Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes
